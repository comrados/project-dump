# Project Dumper & Undumper

## Overview
**Project Dumper** is a command-line utility that recursively scans a project directory, exports its structure and relevant file contents into a structured text file — ideal for feeding source material into LLMs. The paired **Project Undumper** script can then reconstruct the original project from this dumped format.

## Features

### Dumper (`project_dump.py`)
- Visual tree representation of the directory structure
- Dumps the contents of selected files to a structured `.txt` file
- Configurable via `config.json` for:
  - Included file extensions
  - Ignored directories
- Prevents duplicate file dumps
- Clear delimiter-based structure (`<<FILE>>`, `<<CONTENT_START>>`, etc.)

### Undumper (`project_undump.py`)
- Parses a structured `.txt` dump file
- Recreates the original directory structure and file contents
- Supports verbose output for detailed file creation logs

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/comrados/project-dump.git
cd project-dump
```

### 2. Configure the Dumper
Customize the behavior via `config.json`.

Example:
```json
{
  "allowed_extensions": [
    ".py",
    ".txt",
    ".json",
    ".env",
    ".yml",
    ".yaml",
    ".dockerfile",
    "Dockerfile",
    ".gitignore",
    ".dockerignore",
    ".tex",
    ".md"
  ],
  "ignored_dirs": [
    ".git",
    "__pycache__",
    ".idea",
    ".vscode",
    "node_modules",
    "venv",
    ".env",
    "dist",
    "build",
    "graphics"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Dump a Project
```bash
python project_dump.py /path/to/project --config config.json --output output.txt
```

**Options:**
- `--config`: (Optional) Path to a custom configuration file.
- `--output`: (Optional) Output file name (default: `project_dump.txt`).

### 4. Undump a Project
```bash
python project_undump.py --dump-file output.txt --output ./restored_project --verbose
```

**Options:**
- `--dump-file`: Path to the `.txt` file generated by the dumper.
- `--output`: Destination folder to recreate the project.
- `--verbose`: Log each file as it's recreated.

## Output Format
The dump file includes:
- `<<PROJECT_INFO>>` and `<<DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE>>` metadata
- File-by-file sections with headers and content, using consistent delimiters
